                    Hello, my name is Justin Million. I am 23 years old
                     and currently live in Kalispell, MT. I moved to Montana from St. Louis, MO 
                     in 2017. I  love the outdoors and have many hobbies and interests including 
                     hiking, fishing, disc golfing, playing video games, kickboxing and more!</p> 
                
                    </br>
                     I currently work as an Associate Producer at KGEZ Radio in Kalispell, I 
                     also have a Real Estate License in Montana. As of late I have begun learning 
                     coding/web development. I’m new to it but I am really enjoying it and excited
                     to see where it takes me. 
                
                    </br>
                    </br>
                     As I love the outdoors and all the beauty Montana has to offer, I don’t 
                     foresee myself living here forever. I understand the importance of being 
                     flexible and am always open for an opportunity to gain more experience in 
                     different parts of the country.
